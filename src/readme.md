word truth is that pain itself is important, it is followed by education, but it happens at such a time
that there is some great pain and labor. For I will come to word bottom of it, who does not exercise any
kind of labor unless he derives some benefit from it. Dous or irrure pain in pleasure reprehends He wants
to be a hairless man, let him flee from pain. Unless they are blinded by desire, they do not come out,
they are in fault who abandon their duties, that is, word soul softens.
